### 🎨 Inspiration & Design Notes

Took inspiration from https://www.exploreworldwide.com/ , https://www.exploreworld.com/
 for layout and travel vibe.

Fonts were chosen from Google Fonts
.

Used Unsplash API for destination photos, but since image results weren’t always accurate, manual corrections were done.

# 📌 That’s why no automated slideshow was implemented.

# 🤖 Development Process

Took help from ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub Copilot for:

- Enhancements and bug fixes

- Wireframe inspirations

- Design choices

- Problem-solving during development

# 📌 Roadmap / Future Improvements
